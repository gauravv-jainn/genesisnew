/**
 * /careers — the application, on the page's own ground.
 *
 * WHY THE BOTANICAL SCENE IS GONE. This page painted its own world: a mint-fog
 * bank, forty-six SVG stems silhouetted against it and twenty-six drifting
 * motes, all held inside `scene-dark bg-void`. It was built to a reference and
 * it was the only page on the site that did this.
 *
 * Two things were wrong with it and they have the same cause. The colours
 * belonged to no part of the identity — recolouring the fog to brand tokens
 * helped and did not fix it, because a bespoke scene is bespoke whatever hue
 * it is. And `scene-dark` PINS the dark tokens for the subtree, so the theme
 * toggle did nothing here: Genesis switched to light and got a black page with
 * a light switch on it.
 *
 * `Atmosphere` is what every other section on this site stands on. It follows
 * the theme, it carries the brand wash, and it is one line. The page loses a
 * scene it did not need and gains a light mode it should always have had.

          THE CAPSULE IS BACK, and this time it survives the light theme.

          I replaced GlowWord with plain serif italic because on light it
          rendered pale cream on near-white and vanished — the glow IS the
          letterform there, and a glow needs something dark to glow against.
          Genesis wants the capsule, and they are right that it is the one
          piece of character this page has.

          So GlowWord reads its colours from tokens now rather than carrying
          light-on-dark values in its own file. On dark it is unchanged. On
          light the word takes --brand-ink's dark gold, the halo becomes a warm
          bloom BEHIND dark type instead of a light source, and the capsule
          gets an edge you can see against paper.
