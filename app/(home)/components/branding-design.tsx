/**
 * Section 8 — Branding & Design.
 *
 * A bento arrangement (img-021, img-028): one tall statement tile beside the
 * capabilities. Deliberately quieter than the sections either side of it, so
 * the page has a trough between Influencer and the logo wall.
 *
 * QUIET IS NOT THE SAME AS UNLIT. This was the flattest thing on the page: a
 * `tone="neutral"` section with no light at all, next to a grid of six
 * identical grey rectangles carrying one 14px word each. Every other section
 * on this site is lit; this one just had the light switched off, which does
 * not read as restraint, it reads as unfinished.
 *
 * Two changes. The section gets an brand wash — the secondary accent, so it
 * stays quieter than the brand sections around it without being dark. And
 * the capabilities stop being a 3x2 grid of equal boxes: they are a LIST of
 * disciplines, not six things of equal weight, so they are set as a rule-
 * separated column with the count carried in the eyebrow, which is what the
 * editorial references do with a list.

 * The sketch phases and finished mark for one identity, if they are on disk.

 * A hard-coded list of five paths is a list that can be wrong in two
 * directions: name a file that is not there and the section renders broken
 * images at a client; add a sixth sketch and nothing shows it until someone
 * remembers to edit an array. Reading the folder means dropping files in IS
 * the deployment.
 *
 * This is a server component, so the walk happens once at build and never in a

    A CHANGED FILE GETS A CHANGED URL, and this is the second time this project
    has been bitten by not doing it.

    While this feature was being built, `final.png` briefly held a stand-in —
    the Tripgate wordmark — and every layer that caches by URL went on serving
    it after the real Activ Health mark replaced it: the browser, and Next's
    dev-server image cache, which is why Genesis saw Tripgate's logo inside
    Activ Health's card on their own machine and not just on mine. The division
    lockups hit exactly this earlier and were fixed by moving them to a new
    path; that fix does not generalise, because here the FILENAMES are
    Genesis's to choose.

    So the URL carries the file's modification time. Replace an image and its
    URL changes with it, which no cache can get wrong. Same file, same URL,
    still cached — the point is not to defeat caching, it is to stop one URL
    ever meaning two different pictures.

    renamed it 5.png — which is the obvious thing to do once the sketches are
    1 to 4, and it quietly turned the answer into a fifth sketch. A sequence
