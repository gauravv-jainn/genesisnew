/**
 * Genesis Studios — the production vertical.
 *
 * IT WAS THE ONLY VERTICAL WITHOUT A SECTION. Influence, AI Labs and Brand &
 * Design each had one; Studios, the division whose entire argument is the
 * footage, had a link to another page. The brief is direct about it: show the
 * production capability rather than describing it.
 *
 * So the section leads with a wall of Genesis's own work and puts the
 * capability list underneath as a caption. Thirteen named services in a grid
 * is what this section would have been without the clips, and it would have
 * been the least convincing block on a page about making films.
 *
 * THE CLIPS RUN BY THEMSELVES, and only while they are on screen. Genesis
 * asked for the wall to be playing rather than waiting to be hovered, which
 * is right — a reel wall whose reels are still is a contact sheet, and it
 * asked every visitor to discover that the stills were films at all.
 *
 * The reason it was hover-only still stands, though: thirty-two tiles (the row
 * is doubled for the loop) autoplaying is thirty-two live decoders and
 * thirty-two files pulled on load. So each tile watches its own intersection
 * and plays only while it is actually in the viewport, pausing the moment it
 * leaves. Off-screen tiles cost their poster and nothing else, which is what
 * `preload="none"` bought before, and the handful on screen are the only
 * decoders alive at any time.
 *
 * THE WALL DRIFTS, IT DOES NOT SCROLL-JACK. Two rows moving in opposite
 * directions on a CSS transform animation — no JS, no scroll listener,
 * compositor-only. It pauses on hover so a tile can actually be watched, and
 * Reduce Motion stops it entirely and hands the rows back to the reader as
 * ordinary horizontal scrollers.
