/**
 * Positioning and philosophy — both from the brand guidelines, neither of
 * which was anywhere on the site.
 *
 * The deck spends two pages on this. One sets Genesis against the four kinds
 * of agency the market already has and lands on "An AI-Native Creative
 * Company". The other gives three ideas, each with a line: Culture First, AI
 * First, Execution Wins. Between them they are the clearest statement of what
 * this company claims to be, and the homepage went from the hero straight
 * into a list of services without making that claim at all.
 *
 * It sits directly under the hero for that reason: it answers "who is this"
 * before the page starts describing what they sell.
 *
 * The market list is struck through rather than merely listed. The deck's
 * page is a contrast — these four exist, Genesis is not one of them — and a
 * plain list would read as a menu of things Genesis offers, which is the
 * opposite of the point.
