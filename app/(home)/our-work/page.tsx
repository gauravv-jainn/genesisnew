/**
 * /our-work — the Portfolio: the complete library.
 *
 * WORK vs PORTFOLIO, which the brief is explicit about and the site was not:
 * Work is the selected section on the homepage, Portfolio is everything.
 * They now read the one catalogue in lib/work.ts, so a piece cannot appear in
 * one and be missing from the other, and every tile in both leads to the same
 * /work/<slug>.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACED: a second, parallel implementation — its own grid, its
 * own list view, its own search, its own copy of the ten stills, and tiles
 * that opened nothing. It was the better-built of the two galleries and it
 * was the wrong shape: a library whose items have no URL cannot be shared,
 * indexed, or sent to a client, which is the whole reason this page exists.
 *
 * Search went with it. It filtered fourteen items behind a text box; the
 * filter row does that job at this size. It earns its place back when the
 * catalogue is long enough that scanning it is work.
 *
 * IT IS BROWSED NOW, NOT DUMPED. This was one masonry wall of everything,
 * five columns wide, under a row of chips — fourteen tiles in five shapes
 * with no order and nothing telling you what any of it was. Genesis asked for
 * it to work like Netflix, so it does: a billboard, then titled shelves you
 * push sideways, and the shelves collapse to a single grid the moment a
 * filter is picked. What the shelves ARE lives in lib/work.ts, because
 * Genesis's instruction is that they become the folders in the shared Drive.

        Outside the container on purpose. The shelves are full-bleed — a rail
        that stops at the 72rem edge leaves 144px of empty page beyond its
        fade on a large display, which is the cut Genesis has found on every
        rail on this site — so WorkBrowse manages its own width and re-applies
        the container to the parts that need it.
