 * section here was being washed in the one yellow, which is what made the
 * page read monotone — one colour doing the work of a palette.
 *
 * Four sources, placed at different corners so no two sections light the same
 * way, and each scaled by --spectrum. That token is 1 on dark and 0.5 on
 * light, because the same alpha of colour reads about twice as strongly on
 * paper as it does on black.
 *
 * Deliberately a TINT. The guidelines set the ratio at 70% white/black, 20%
 * grey, 10% yellow and say plainly that yellow is never the background — so
 * these sit where the hue is felt rather than seen. The measured lift on the
 * section ground is under two points of luminance.
