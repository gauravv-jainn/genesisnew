/**
 * One AI avatar, rendered identically whether it arrived as a dialog over the
 * roster or as its own page.
 *
 * THE PORTRAIT KEEPS ITS OWN SHAPE, which is the fix for the crop Genesis
 * flagged. It used to be a full-width band whose height was clamped to the
 * viewport — a 2.3:1 letterbox cut out of a 9:16 photograph. Anchoring that
 * band to the top showed the wall above the subject's head; anchoring it to
 * the centre showed a torso. There is no crop of a portrait into a wide strip
 * that contains a face, so the strip is gone: the picture is a 3:4 panel in
 * its own column and the reading sits beside it.
 *
 * IT OMITS WHAT IS NOT WRITTEN. Bio, languages and use cases are Genesis's to
 * supply and every block disappears while its field is pending. What a
 * visitor sees today is the avatar, its name and the brand it fronts — all of
 * which are real.
 *
 * TODO(content): `bio` is the story Genesis asked to appear here and it is the
 * one thing this view cannot invent. Adi and Diya front a named insurer;
 * writing a backstory for them would be putting words in a client's mouth. The
 * Story section below renders the moment the field is filled.
