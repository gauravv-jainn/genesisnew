/**
 * The AI avatar roster, dealt as a hand of cards.
 *
 * THE DECK'S OWN BOARD. The AI Lab page fans seven portraits across the
 * bottom of the frame, overlapping, tipping further as they run out to the
 * edges, with one held upright in the middle and lit. It reads as a roster
 * being shown to you — which is what a roster of avatars is.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACED. A five-panel rotateY wall at 1200px perspective. That
 * was built from a different reference (a curved video wall) and it had two
 * problems here: rotateY foreshortens a face until the outer panels are
 * unreadable slivers, and it made five avatars look like one continuous
 * screen rather than five separate people. A flat fan keeps every face at
 * full width and every card visibly its own object.
 *
 * THE GEOMETRY IS A PIVOT, NOT AN OFFSET. The first attempt rotated each
 * card about its own centre and then pushed it down by the square of its
 * distance from the middle. That is the arithmetic of an arc and it produced
 * the opposite of one — an arch, curving UP at the ends — because rotating
 * about the centre swings the top of an outer card toward the middle while
 * the drop moves the whole card down. It also broke the layout: transforms do
 * not affect flow, so the pushed-down cards fell straight out of the bottom
 * of their own container and were clipped.
 *
 * A hand of cards fans from a point BELOW the hand. So every card sits in the
 * same place and the only transform is a rotation about an origin four card
 * heights down. The spread, the descent toward the edges and the overlap all
 * fall out of that one number — there is nothing left to tune against itself,
 * and the container's height is a fixed multiple of a card's rather than
 * something that has to be kept in sync with a drop formula.
 *
 * NO OPACITY RAMP, deliberately, and this is the second time it has been
 * written down: the board keeps every card at full brightness, and the
 * outermost one is as vivid as the centre. Fading the flanks produces the
 * generic 3D-carousel look the board is not.
 *
 * IT DEALS ITSELF, which is what Genesis's animation shows and what this was
 * missing: the fan simply existed, fully spread, the moment the section
 * appeared. The hand now arrives stacked — every card at zero rotation, one
 * on top of another, sitting a little low — and opens outward from the middle
 * as it comes into view.
 *
 * THE STAGGER IS BY DISTANCE FROM THE CENTRE, not by index. Dealing left to
 * right would put the upright card, the one the whole fan is arranged around,
 * fourth in a queue. Ordering by distance lands the centre first and then
 * releases each pair outward, which is how a hand of cards actually opens and
 * what makes the middle read as the card being presented rather than as the
 * one that happens to be in the middle.
 *
 * ONCE, and never again on the way back up: a fan that re-deals every time it
 * re-enters the viewport turns a flourish into a tic.

/**
 * Degrees between neighbouring cards, and how far below a card the pivot

 *
 * THESE TWO ARE ONE DECISION. Spread is the product of them — pivot distance
 * times angle — so a near pivot with a big angle and a far pivot with a small
 * one cover the same width and look nothing alike. The near one tips the
 * outer cards hard and, because the bottom of a card is closer to a pivot
 * beneath it than the top is, jams their bottom edges together. That is
 * exactly where the names are, and at 400%/10deg the roles on the flanking
 * cards were being eaten by their neighbours.
 *
 * 650%/6.6deg covers the same width with a card's bottom edge at 85% of its
 * top edge's radius instead of 75%, which leaves the overlap at the name line
 * around 15% rather than 27% — enough to read every role, still enough to
 * read as a hand of cards rather than a row of them.

/**
 * Is there room to fan?
 *
 * THE FAN IS 775px WIDE AND A PHONE IS 375, and the answer used to be a
 * horizontal scroller — the hand at full size with the viewport panning
 * across it. It reads as broken rather than as scrollable: what you see on
 * load is two cards cut in half at both edges, with nothing saying the rest
 * is a thumb away. Genesis's word for it was "fucked up", and they are right.
 *
 * So below 880px the fan is not a fan. Same seven cards, same links, laid out
 * as two centred rows — four and three — with no rotation, no pivot and no
 * sway. Everyone is on screen at their real size and the page does not move
 * sideways.
 *
 * Measured rather than assumed, because the geometry is real and a Tailwind
 * `sm:` on the transform would not have been enough: the rotation is written
 * by Framer as an inline style, and an inline transform beats any class.
 * matchMedia is the only place both the layout and the animation can agree.
 *
 * 880, NOT 640, AND IT IS NOT A TAILWIND BREAKPOINT. The fan's width is the
 * card's width times the geometry, and the card is
 * `clamp(7.5rem, 14vw, 13rem)` — so below 857px viewport the clamp floor
 * pins the card at 120px and the hand stops shrinking with the page. It stays
 * 832px wide however narrow the phone gets, which is why at 673px the outer
 * two cards hung 79px off each edge of a container that clips, and why at 840
 * they still overran it by 4. 880 is the first width where the hand fits with
 * a margin either side.
 *
 * Every size decision below hangs off `fan` for the same reason: a `sm:` on
 * the caption would have re-opened the gap between 640 and 880.
 *
 * Server-rendered as the fan — the desktop case, and the one where a wrong
 * first paint is cheapest: a phone corrects on hydration, in the same frame
 * the deal-in animation would have started anyway.
