/**
 * The divisions orb — a point-cloud sphere that assembles itself, thinks, and
 * answers the pointer.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FOR. The services heading claims "four divisions, one system",
 * and the section under it was a list of four names with nothing saying they
 * were one thing. Genesis's own films put the four names around a single
 * dotted sphere with the wordmark at its core, so the picture argues the
 * sentence: one body, four things orbiting it. The sphere ASSEMBLING out of
 * scattered points when you first reach the section is the same argument in
 * motion, and it is the only entrance animation on the page.
 *
 * WHY CANVAS AND NOT HOUDINI. The Paint API looks like the right tool for a
 * generated background and is the wrong one here. A paint worklet is a pure
 * function of the element's size and custom properties — it cannot keep state
 * between frames, so every particle's excitation, every travelling pulse and
 * every ripple would have to be serialised out to CSS properties and back on
 * each tick, and the whole surface repaints whenever any one of them changes.
 * This needs ~2000 points carrying their own state at 60Hz. That is what a
 * canvas and a typed array are for. Houdini would also be the only part of
 * this page that silently renders nothing in Safari.
 *
 * WHY IT COSTS ALMOST NOTHING.
 *   - Points are stamped from pre-rendered sprites rather than arc() + fill().
 *   - Compositing is `lighter`, which is order-independent, so the depth sort
 *     a point cloud normally needs every frame is not needed at all.
 *     Overlapping points also brighten, which gives the silhouette its
 *     density for free.
 *   - Every per-point value that has to survive a frame lives in a
 *     Float32Array, so the loop allocates nothing and never triggers a GC
 *     pause mid-scroll.
 *   - The synapse links are the one part that could go quadratic, and they
 *     are drawn only between points the pointer has already excited — a set
 *     of at most a hundred, not two thousand.
 *   - The loop is suspended when the section is off-screen and when the tab
 *     is hidden. Scrolled past, this is a sleeping canvas.

 *
 * These are travelling waves. Each source is an axis; `dot(point, axis)` is
 * the cosine of the angle from it, so a surface of constant dot is a circle
 * around that pole — which means `sin(dot * k - wt)` is a set of concentric
 * rings propagating out from it. Three sources at different frequencies and
 * speeds, running in different directions, interfere into the folds the
 * reference has, while every one of them is a smooth band that leaves the
 * silhouette round.
 *
 * It is also cheaper than the noise it replaces: three dot products and three
 * sines per point, against a full Perlin lookup.

 * `k` is how many fronts fit pole to pole, `w` their speed and sign their
 * direction, `amp` their share of the displacement — the three sum to less
 * than one so the total stays bounded and the crest ceiling above holds.

 * and are the one liberty taken: a sphere needs somewhere to fall away to or
 * it reads as a flat disc, so the ramp continues past the brand violet along
 * the same hue and darkens. Only as far as #462e84, though — the first pass
 * ran it down to a near-black indigo, and at these alphas that end of the

 * invented either — the last stop is that amber lifted toward white for the

        — a third of the way toward the viewer — where the projected radius is
        1.053 times the sphere's own. On top of that the breathing adds 1.3%
        and the pointer's lift another 7.5%, and each dot is drawn about two
        dot-widths across.

        At 0.46 all of that added up to 98% of the canvas: the sphere sat hard
        against its own bounds, the outermost ring was shaved on every side,
        and moving the cursor to an edge pushed dots off it entirely.

        0.4 is what the crest ceiling allows. A crest rides CREST above the
        radius and the pointer lift adds 7.5%, so the worst case is
        1.095 x 1.053 x 1.075 = 1.24 — and 0.4 x 1.24 = 0.496 of the span,
        which is the whole box and not a pixel more. It was 0.375 when CREST

        screen stayed black, so switching to light appeared to do nothing.

        The requirement was never the section, only the ground directly under
        the sphere. This is that ground — a dark pool sized to the orb, fading
        out well before the edge of the box, so on paper it reads as a lit
        stage the sphere is standing on rather than as a section that forgot
        to change. In the dark theme it lands on near-black and is invisible,
        which is exactly right.

            SOLID UNDER THE WHOLE SPHERE, THEN A SHORT TAIL — and getting that
            order wrong is what made the first attempt a smudge.

            The arithmetic: the sphere's radius is 0.4 of the box, so it spans
            80% of it, and this pool is inset -6% so its own radius is 56 in
            those units against the sphere's 40. The sphere's edge therefore
            sits at 71% of the pool's radius. The previous version went solid
            only to 30% and spent everything after that fading, which put
            three-quarters of the sphere on a half-transparent ground — the dots
            composite with `lighter`, so on a pale ground they washed out, and
            what was left read as a dark cloud rather than a stage.

            Solid to 74% now, which is just past the sphere's rim, then the
            whole falloff in the last quarter. The sphere lands on black; the
            page gets a defined edge instead of a haze.

            EVERY STOP IS MULTIPLIED BY --orb-stage, which is 1 on paper and 0
            in the dark theme. There the page is already dark and the pool has
            nothing to do but show up as a black disc on a violet field, so it
            is switched off rather than tuned down — one token, defined beside
            the rest of the theme, and the alphas below scale themselves.
