          THIS WAS THE CUT ACROSS THE LOWER HALF. The diagonal scrim was

          flat black for its first third, then the entire remaining alpha
          dumped over the next thirty percent and finished by 62%. Two things
          go wrong with that. It reaches zero well before the top of the card,
          so the scrim has an END inside the artwork, and a gradient that
          stops mid-surface draws an edge exactly like a clip does. And the
          fall from 0.7 to 0 in thirty percent is steep enough to band, so
          that edge is not even soft. Four posters in a rail, four diagonal
          seams across their lower halves.

          The stops below are an eased falloff over the FULL height — closely
          spaced where the alpha is changing fastest, arriving at zero at
          100% rather than 62%. There is no point on the card where the scrim
          ends, so there is no line. The top scrim gets the same treatment.
