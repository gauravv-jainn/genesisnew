/**
 * Social links.
 *
 * NO STARS ANY MORE, at Genesis's instruction, and the reason they were here
 * is gone too. The spec asked for "Social Media Icons (like stars)" and the
 * row drew a four-point star behind each mark because the old hand-drawn
 * lockup carried one — but that star was a placeholder invention that appears
 * nowhere in the 2026 identity, and it was removed from the wordmark itself
 * when the real artwork arrived. Three of them sitting under the footer were
 * the last place it survived: a shape from a logo the site no longer uses,
 * large enough to read as the content rather than as the frame around it.
 *
 * So the icons are the icons. The target stays generous — the star was doing
 * that job as well as decorating — and the hover moves the mark's own colour
 * rather than lighting a silhouette behind it.
 *
 * The marks are drawn inline. lucide-react removed its brand icons in v1, and
 * pulling in a whole icon package for three glyphs is not a trade worth
 * making.
 *
 * TODO(links): handles are placeholders until the real accounts are confirmed.
