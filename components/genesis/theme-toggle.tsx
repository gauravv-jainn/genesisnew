 * which then beats the OS in both directions and persists.
 *
 * Read through `useSyncExternalStore` rather than `useState` + an effect. The
 * theme lives outside React — in an attribute, in localStorage, and in a media
 * query — and this is the hook for exactly that. It also removes the
 * one-frame flicker a state-in-effect version has, because the store is read
 * during render rather than corrected after mount.
 *
 * Rendered as role="switch" so assistive tech announces the on/off state; the
 * label says what the control WILL DO, which is what a screen-reader user
 * needs at the moment they reach it.

          THE TRACK HAS TO BE A TRACK. It was --hover-wash over
          --glass-border, and on paper that resolves to 7% black on a pill
          that is 72% white — measured, a 1.06:1 track. The knob was solid
          and perfectly visible, so what a light-theme visitor saw was a dark
          dot floating in the nav with nothing around it: not a switch, and
          not obviously anything. Genesis could not find it, which is the
          whole report.

          Own values rather than tokens here, and deliberately. Every token
          that could carry this is tuned for a surface sitting ON the page,
          and this one sits on the glass pill, which is already a lightened
          plate over whatever is behind it — so the same 7% that reads as a
          panel edge elsewhere disappears here. 14% ink with a 34% rim is the
          faintest that still reads as a groove on both grounds — 50% on the
          rim is what takes the control's boundary past 3:1 against the pill,
          which is the threshold a UI component's edge is meant to clear.
