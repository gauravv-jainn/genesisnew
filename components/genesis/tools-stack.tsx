 * The tools stack — built to p03_1, for the spec's "TOOLS WE USE".
 *
 * A column of sources on the left, each feeding a glowing curve that
 * converges on a single point beside the studio mark. The curves are one SVG
 * with a shared gradient, and the flow is a stroke-dashoffset animation, so
 * the whole thing is a handful of paths rather than a particle system.
 *
 * The convergence is the message: many inputs, one output.
