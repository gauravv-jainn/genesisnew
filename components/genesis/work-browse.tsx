/**

 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACED. One masonry wall of everything, five columns wide,
 * behind a row of filter chips: fourteen tiles in five different shapes with
 * no order, no grouping and nothing saying what any of it was. Genesis asked
 * for Netflix, and the part of that layout that does the work is the SHELF —
 * a titled row of a few things, so the page is read rather than scanned.
 *
 * TWO MODES, WHICH IS ALSO HOW NETFLIX WORKS.
 *
 *   BROWSE (no filter) — a billboard and then the shelves from lib/work.
 *   GENRE (a filter picked) — the shelves collapse to one grid of everything
 *     that matches, because once you have said what you want, rows that
 *     re-sort it are in the way.
 *
 * THE SHELVES ARE DATA, NOT LAYOUT. `workRows` is the whole definition of
 * what rows exist and what goes in them, and it lives beside the catalogue.
 * Genesis's instruction is that these become the folders in the shared Drive;
 * when that arrives it is an edit to one array in lib/work.ts, and nothing in
 * this file learns about it.

 * Netflix artwork is; forcing one aspect here would crop the client's name off
