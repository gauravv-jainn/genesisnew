/**
 * CASE STUDIES — a different question from the portfolio.
 *
 * The brief draws the line and the site did not: Portfolio answers "what has
 * Genesis made?", Case Studies answers "can Genesis solve my business
 * problem?". So this is not a prettier gallery. Every entry is shaped
 * Problem -> Strategy -> Execution -> Result, and a piece of work belongs here
 * only when there is a measured outcome to put at the end of it.
 *
 * IT IS A PAGE, NOT AN ANCHOR. "Case Studies" in the nav pointed at a section
 * on the homepage, which is the one thing the brief says it must not be — a
 * marketing head evaluating Genesis needs a URL they can send to a colleague,
 * and a homepage anchor is not that.
 *
 * THE NARRATIVE IS EMPTY AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. The four clients are real and
 * confirmed. Problem, strategy, execution and every metric are Genesis's to
 * write; each block is rendered and omitted while pending. A "Results" heading
 * over invented figures beside Aditya Birla's name is not a placeholder, it is
 * a claim about Aditya Birla.
