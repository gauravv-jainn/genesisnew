/**
 * Prisma 7 no longer connects on its own — it requires a driver adapter.
 * We use `PrismaNeon`, which speaks Neon's serverless protocol over
 * WebSockets. That avoids holding raw TCP connections from short-lived
 * Vercel functions (which exhausts Postgres connection limits) while still
 * supporting interactive transactions, unlike the HTTP-only adapter.
 *
 * The client is constructed lazily. Building the app must not require a
 * reachable database, and an unset `DATABASE_URL` should surface as a clear
 * error at the call site rather than a crash at import time.
