/**
 * Resolving a public-looking media path to a file inside Genesis's Drive.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR, AND WHAT IT IS NOT FOR. Drive is the file store — the
 * place Genesis actually keeps footage and stills — so the site should be able
 * to read from it rather than requiring every asset to be committed to the
 * repository and redeployed. That is a workflow win: drop a file in a folder,
 * it is on the site.
 *
 * It is NOT a content delivery network and must not be used as one. Drive
 * rate-limits per file, serves interstitials under load, and its Range support
 * is poor enough that scrubbing a video through it is unreliable. Anything
 * fetched here is therefore fetched ONCE and then served from our own cache
 * headers for a year — see the route in app/api/media. Drive is the origin of
 * record; it is never in the hot path twice for the same file.
 *
 * PATHS MIRROR /public. `work/clips/10.mp4` here is the same file that lives
 * at /work/clips/10.mp4 in the repo, so switching a caller between the two is
 * a prefix and nothing else, and a Drive folder that mirrors /public is a
 * structure a person can keep tidy without being told a scheme.

/**
 * Where each numbered film actually lives in Genesis's Drive.
 *
 * THE FOLDERS ARE ORGANISED BY SHOOT, NOT BY THE SITE'S PATHS, and that is
 * reasonable — they are Genesis's working folders, and asking a person to
 * restructure their Drive to match a URL scheme is asking the wrong party to
 * do the mapping. The site asked for `work/clips/1.mp4`, the file is `1.mp4`
 * at the root of one folder, and nothing resolved. This table is the mapping,
 * written down once.
 *
 * Two sources, because the footage arrived in two batches:
 *   1-32   "With 2 seconds thumbnail"   — named 1.mp4 … 32.mp4
 *   33-42  "Website Content Temporary"  — named after the property filmed
 *
 * Note 40: `Chembur Plot` has no file extension in Drive. It is matched by the
 * name Drive actually holds, not the name it ought to have.
