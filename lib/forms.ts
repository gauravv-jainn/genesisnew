/**
 * The three lead forms, defined once as data.
 *
 * WHY A SPEC AND NOT THREE COMPONENTS. Genesis needs a creator form, a brand
 * form and a small popup, and they are the same machine at three lengths:
 * same validation, same rate limit, same table, same honeypot, same error
 * rendering. Written as three components they drift within a fortnight — one
 * grows a field the others do not, one loses its error styling in a refactor.
 *
 * WHY THE ZOD SCHEMA IS DERIVED FROM THE SPEC RATHER THAN WRITTEN BESIDE IT.
 * A field list and a validator that must agree, maintained separately, is the
 * oldest bug in form code: someone adds a field to the UI and the server
 * silently drops it, or tightens the server and the UI never says why. There
 * is one list here, and the schema is built from it, so they cannot disagree.
 *
 * WHERE THE ANSWERS GO. `name`, `email`, `company` and `message` are columns
 * on contact_submissions. Everything else — a creator's follower count, a
 * brand's budget range — goes into the `metadata` JSON column that already
 * exists on that model. No migration, and nothing is thrown away.
