   * THE REAL LOGO FILES, at last. This was a list of NAMES rendered as text

   *
   * THIRTY WERE SUPPLIED AND TWENTY-NINE ARE HERE. The missing one is set in
   * script inside a yellow ticket and cannot be read with enough confidence
   * to print a client's name on a public page — which is the SAME mark, and
   * the same reason, recorded against the old text list. A misspelled client
   * is worse than a missing one. It goes in the moment someone names it.
   * TODO(content): identify file 21 of the Pallete of Brand Works.
   *
   * `ink` IS MEASURED, AND THE CHIP IS ALWAYS PAPER. An earlier pass split
   * the wall between white chips and dark ones so every mark had a ground
   * that suited it — which worked, and looked like a chequerboard. Genesis
   * was right that a wall of client logos wants one surface.
   *
   * So the ground is uniform and the seven marks that cannot live on it are
   * named here instead. Sampling mean luminance AND saturation over every
   * opaque pixel separates two cases the first pass had conflated:
   *
   *   "invert" — social-samosa (L 0.98, sat 0.00) and someplace-else
   *     (L 0.99, sat 0.01) are monochrome white. Inverting a mark with no
   *     colour in it produces the same mark in black and loses nothing at
   *     all, which is why only these two get it.
   *   "darken" — mahindra-finance, the-lalit-mumbai, ht-brunch, bumble and
   *     lizol sit between L 0.68 and 0.85 and DO carry colour, so inverting
   *     would turn The Lalit's red square cyan. They are dimmed instead,
   *     which holds their hue and costs some saturation.
   *
   * Everything else is left exactly as supplied.
   *
   * `ratio` IS THE FILE'S OWN WIDTH/HEIGHT, and it is here because it is what
   * decides how big each mark is allowed to be. These range from 0.89 (LN
   * Construction, near square) to 12.63 (Mahindra Finance, a long strip), and
   * a set of marks that different by fourteen times CANNOT share one box: in
   * the square chip this replaced, object-contain left Mahindra Finance 5.7px
   * tall while a square mark stood at 72. That is the size problem Genesis
   * kept pointing at, and it was never a padding value — it was the geometry.
   * See client-logos.tsx for what the number is used for.
   *
   * TODO(assets): dark-ink versions of those seven would let every mark run
   * untouched. Dimming a client's colour is a compromise, not a preference.
