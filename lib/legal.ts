/**
 * Privacy and Terms — INTERIM, AND SAYING SO ON THE PAGE.
 *
 * Genesis asked for temporary pages. Two things follow from "temporary" and
 * both are deliberate:
 *
 * 1. Nothing here is invented. The policy describes what the site actually
 *    does — three forms writing to a Google Sheet, Vercel Analytics, Sentry,
 *    a WhatsApp link — and stops. It names no retention period, no legal
 *    basis under a named statute and no jurisdiction, because those are
 *    decisions Genesis and their counsel make, not ones a placeholder should
 *    make for them.
 * 2. Every page carries a visible interim notice with the contact address, so
 *    a visitor is never misled about what they are reading and always has a
 *    way to ask.
 *
 * TODO(legal): replace wholesale with counsel-reviewed copy before launch.
 * Do not edit these paragraphs into the real policy — start from the real
 * one. See the same TODO in components/genesis/site-footer.tsx.
