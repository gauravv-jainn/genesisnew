/**
 * PROOF FIGURES — one source of truth.
 *
 * The site was carrying three different answers to "how many campaigns?"
 * (500+, 50+, and 70 in the brief), two to "how many brands?" (200+ and 30+)
 * and two to "what reach?" (50M+ and 500M+), across the Influence section, the
 * journey board and the influencer page. A visitor who reads two sections
 * stops believing either.
 *
 * Every figure on the site now comes from here. That does not make them
 * right — it makes them one edit instead of five, and it makes the contested
 * ones greppable.
 *
 * `confirmed: false` marks a figure with more than one source. Where sources
 * disagreed the value below is the one with the strongest provenance, and the
 * alternatives are recorded beside it so nothing is quietly lost. These need
 * signing off against current reporting before launch — which is the client's
 * call, not ours, and is why they are flagged rather than reconciled.
