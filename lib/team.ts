/**
 * The team.
 *
 * TWO PEOPLE, WHICH IS THE INSTRUCTION AND NOT AN OMISSION. This carried
 * eight placeholder members — job titles standing in for names, each drawn as
 * a monogram — while Genesis decided who goes on the page. They have: the
 * founder and the head of creatives, and nobody else for now.
 *
 * THE PORTRAITS ARE THE AI AVATARS, also at Genesis's instruction. Shivam and
 * Tanvi are both on the AI Lab roster and the roster's own frames are the
 * pictures we have of them. The team tiles do not point at those 1080x1920
 * files directly: a 9:16 full-length shot dropped into a 4:5 box crops to
 * whatever object-cover decides, which put the two of them at visibly
 * different distances. public/team/ holds a hand-cut 4:5 crop of each,
 * framed so the eyes sit at 30% of the height and the head fills about a
 * third of the frame in both. That is what "consistent" means here, and it
 * cannot be done with a CSS keyword.
 *
 * The `pending` flag and the monogram tile stay for the next person added
 * before their photograph arrives.
