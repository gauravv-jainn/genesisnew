/**
 * Turn a Google Drive folder of master videos into web-ready hover previews.
 *
 *   node scripts/ingest-drive-clips.mjs <folderId>
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Genesis's work lands as full-resolution masters — the first
 * folder averaged 51MB a file, 2GB in total, single clips 200x the weight of
 * the whole homepage. None of it is servable. This produces, per file, a
 * four-second silent loop at 720px on the long edge plus a poster frame.
 * Measured: 11.5MB -> 82KB, about 140x.
 *
 * IT USES THE DRIVE API, not the public folder view. That matters for three
 * reasons beyond being the supported path:
 *
 *   1. It reads PRIVATE folders. The scrape it replaced only ever worked on
 *      folders set to "anyone with the link", which is not where finished
 *      client work should have to live.
 *   2. It returns METADATA — real filenames, sizes, mime types, descriptions,
 *      and the folder each file sits in. Files arriving as 1.mp4..32.mp4 carry
 *      no client anywhere in them, and the folder tree is the one place that
 *      information plausibly exists. The script walks subfolders and records
 *      the path, then writes a manifest.
 *   3. It is stable. The previous version parsed `embeddedfolderview` HTML,
 *      an undocumented endpoint that changes without notice.
 *
 * IT STILL DOES NOT DOWNLOAD THE MASTERS. ffmpeg is handed the API's media
 * URL plus a bearer token, and range-requests only the leading seconds it
 * needs — six seconds a file rather than a 2GB pull that is then discarded.
 *
 * SETUP: set GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON (raw or base64) in .env.local, and
 * share the folder with that account's client_email — a service account with
 * no share sees an empty Drive and reports zero files rather than an error.
 * Requires ffmpeg on PATH.
